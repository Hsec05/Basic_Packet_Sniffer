# Basic_Packet_Sniffer
This is a basic python based packet sniffer which will capture different type of packets

For running the code successfully you need to have this libraries installed in your system:

Command: pip install scapy matplotlib






1)This program can pause and resume the packet sniffing and also change the theme if you want from dark to light.

2)You can visualise the which type of packets are captured and also clear the output.

3)I have given filter option if you just one type of packets, that is, if you want only tcp packets to be captured, it will only capture tcp packets and rest all will be ignored. For that select TCP option in the filter box and click on apply.

4)Search option is given so that if you want to search any particular thing. When you click on set it will highlight the text with yellow highlighter.

5)Checkboxes are given for IP, Protocol, Ports and Sizes, so if you want to see all those things check all the boxes. And if you want to see only certain things, than check only those boxes.
